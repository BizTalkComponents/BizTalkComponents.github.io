## Description ##
The Context RegEx Match component contains functionality to read a specific value in the context of a message, 
perform a regular expression match on that value and in case of a successful match promote a fixed value 
to another part of the message context. 

The component is useful when receiving a message with a promoted value in its context that one then want to evaluate rules against to for example simplify filtering in routing of messages.
